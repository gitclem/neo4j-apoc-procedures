[.emphasis]
apoc.math.round(value,[prec],mode=['CEILING','FLOOR','UP','DOWN','HALF_EVEN','HALF_DOWN','HALF_UP','DOWN','UNNECESSARY'])

Take from Java round library.  Mode means

|===
|Mode|Explanation
|CEILING|Rounding mode to round towards positive infinity.
|FLOOR|Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity.
|UP|Rounding mode to round away from zero.
|DOWN|Rounding mode to round towards zero.
|HALF_EVEN|Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case, round towards the even neighbor.
|HALF_DOWN| Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round down.
|HALF_UP|Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up.
|UNNECESSARY|Rounding mode to assert that the requested operation has an exact result, hence no rounding is necessary.  In cases where rounding would occur, a `java.lang.ArithmeticException` will be thrown.
